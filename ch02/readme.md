# Income Mobility, Income Inequality and Mortality in the U.S.

- We use CDC mortality records from 2000 to 2014 (restricted data) and Chetty's income mobility estimates at the county level
- The `src` folder contains all the code to reproduce the analysis in R
- The `output` folder contains tables (Latex) and figures
